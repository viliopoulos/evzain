## 🗄️ Data Collection Infrastructure

### Database Schema (`/supabase/migrations/20241018210000_data_collection_system.sql`)

**4 Core Tables**:
1. **`waitlist_signups`** - Email collection with source tracking
2. **`assessment_responses`** - Complete survey data with derived insights
3. **`web_analytics`** - Event tracking (page views, clicks, etc.)
4. **`email_campaign_log`** - Email delivery tracking

**Smart Features**:
- Auto-computed fields: `athlete_segment`, `commitment_level`, `primary_focus`
- Categorization functions based on sports science principles
- Analytics view for dashboard queries
- Session-based anonymous tracking

### Data Collection Library (`/lib/data-collection.ts`)

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
addToWaitlist(email, source)           // Waitlist signup + welcome email
submitAssessment(data, email)          // Save response + completion email
trackEvent(eventType, eventData)       // Web analytics
trackPageView(pageName)                // Page tracking
trackButtonClick(buttonName, location) // Click tracking
getSessionId()                         // Anonymous user tracking
```

### Email Automation (`/app/api/send-email/route.ts`)

**2 Email Templates**:

## 🧠 Decision Tree & Recommendation Engine

### Comprehensive Logic Document (`/docs/DECISION_TREE_LOGIC.md`)

**5 Major Decision Branches**:

1. **Goal-Driven Pathways**
   - Master Specific Techniques → Technical mastery focus
   - Return from Injury → Safe progression + psychological readiness
   - Compete at Higher Level → Periodization + mental toughness
   - Improve Fitness & Health → Sustainable habits + balanced training

2. **Progress Tracking Awareness**
   - Clear progress → Advanced optimization
   - Some sense → Systematic tracking tools
   - Not sure → Baseline measurements
   - No way → Subjective tracking to start

3. **Reading Habits & Learning Style**
   - Daily readers → In-depth, research-heavy content
   - Weekly → Balanced theory + practice
   - Occasional → Quick wins, actionable tips
   - Rarely → Visual, action-first, early teasers

4. **Mental Challenges & Strategies**
   - Pattern matching to research-backed interventions
   - Specific strategies for overthinking, focus, nerves, confidence, motivation

5. **Confusion Frequency**
   - High confusion → Education priority, transparent "why"
   - Low confusion → Maintain trust, offer optional deep dives

### Research Foundation
- **Sports Science**: Periodization, load management, adaptation
- **Biomechanics**: Movement efficiency, injury prevention
- **Recovery Science**: Sleep, nutrition, supercompensation
- **Sports Psychology**: Goal-setting, mindfulness, mental toughness, flow state
