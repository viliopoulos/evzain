          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-6">How We Started</h3>
          
          <div className="space-y-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Evzain was born from a simple question: what if elite coaching could be available to everyone? I saw too many athletes doing the same generic workouts and getting the same generic results. I also knew from my own career that the difference between a good season and a breakthrough season is often one small change, done in the right order and at the right time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We started by collecting what actually matters. Pro training patterns. Peer reviewed studies in recovery, biomechanics and sports psychology. Honest feedback from real athletes. Those three sources combine into the core of our work. We do the research so you get recommendations that are precise, explain the why, and fit your life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              At Evzain we focus on clarity and trust. The first version of everything is human delivered and coach reviewed. We work closely with athletes to refine the approach, then automate the patterns that prove themselves. That means you get practical, validated advice from day one and long term intelligence as the product learns from real progress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We want to democratize access to expert training. Not by replacing coaches, but by scaling the best practices they use. If you want to get better without the noise, Evzain is built for that.

              I've been in locker rooms, late night flights, and pressure cooker moments where the next rep or decision mattered more than anything else. I learned how the mind moves the body and how tiny shifts stack into real gains. I also learned that most advice out there is loud and shallow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Evzain is my answer to that problem. We collect the best evidence and fold it into human judgment. For now I lead the work quietly, testing and refining with a few athletes at a time. When it is time, Evzain will be louder. For now we build carefully, measure everything, and deliver what actually moves the needle.
